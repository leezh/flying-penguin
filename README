Dear gamer,
        Hello and thank you for trying out flying-penguin. This is my
first ever full project and so please do not be too harsh on it. :) The
project is hosted on github so you could always get the latest files
there. If you find any bugs you can email the maintainers (listed in the
AUTHORS file) with the details of the problems, or post them at the
Issues section of the github page.
        Enjoy the game!
                                                          Lee Zher Huei

PS: If you got an awesome song that you want to contribute that is under
CC-BY-SA, or less restrictive, email me if you want it to be part of the
of the project.

==== External Files ====
This project includes files from the Liberation Font project which is
distributed under GPLv2 with a font exception. Source files and license
details could be found here: https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/

==== Preparing ====
For ArchLinux:
  You could grab the PKGBUILD file from the AUR and build it. Refer to
  the ArchWiki for details if you don't know what this is about.
  
  Alternatively, run this command (as root) and you're done:
    pacman -S sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer freetype2 g++ cmake

For Ubnutu / Debian:
  Run this command and you're done:
    sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl1.2-dev \
    libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libfreetype6 \
    libfreetype6-dev g++ cmake

For other Linux distros:
  Install all the codeblocks, SDL and freetype2 packages including the
  development files using your distro's package manager.

For Windows:
  TODO

==== BUILDING  AND INSTALLING ====
For building in Linux:
  In the parent directory, run:
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make
      make install

For building in Windows:
  TODO

==== WHAT IS SOL ====
SOL: Object-orientated Loop-based Game Framework is a C++ wrapper for
SDL and Freetype2 that I wrote such that it may easily be reused in some
other project. However, I haven't bothered writing out the documentation
and it still isn't as complete as I would like it to be.
