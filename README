Dear gamer,
        Hello and thank you for trying out flying-penguin. This is my
first ever full project and so please do not be too harsh on it. :) The
project is hosted on github so you could always get the latest files
there. If you find any bugs you can email the maintainers (list of that
int the AUTHORS file) with the details of the problems or post them at
the github page.
        Enjoy the game!
                                                          Lee Zher Huei

PS: If you got an awesome song that you want to contribute that is under
CC-BY-SA, or less restrictive, email me if you want it to be part of the
of the project.
