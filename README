Dear gamer,
        Hello and thank you for trying out flying-penguin. This is my
first ever full project and so please do not be too harsh on it. :) The
project is hosted on github so you could always get the latest files
there. If you find any bugs you can email the maintainers (listed in the
AUTHORS file) with the details of the problems, or post them at the
Issues section of the github page.
        Enjoy the game!
                                                          Lee Zher Huei

PS: If you got an awesome song that you want to contribute that is under
CC-BY-SA, or less restrictive, email me if you want it to be part of the
of the project.

==== External Files ====
This project includes files from the Liberation Font project which is
distributed under GPLv2 with a font exception. Source files and license
details could be found here: https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/

==== Preparing ====
For ArchLinux:
  You could grab the PKGBUILD file from the AUR and build it. Refer to
  the ArchWiki for details if you don't know what this is about.
  TODO: Actually upload the PKGBUILD file.

For Ubnutu / Debian:
  Run this command and all the development files that you need and their
  dependencies would be installed.
    sudo apt-get install cmake libsfml-dev libglu-dev g++ make

For other Linux distros:
  Ensure you have all the G++, GNU Make, CMake and SFML packages
  including the development files using your distro's package manager.
  
  In the case of SFML, some of the older distros wouldn't have them so
  you might need to download, compile and install them yourself. Just
  follow the tutorial there and you should be fine.
    http://www.sfml-dev.org/

For Windows:
  Firstly, you would need an IDE / compiler of your choice. If you don't
  have any, a recommended one for beginers is Code::Blocks with MinGW.
    http://www.codeblocks.org/
  
  Secondly, you would need the latest SFML SDK. Download the one most
  appropriate for your IDE / compiler:
    http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
  However, following the tutorial on that site wouldn't work with the
  project's setup. Instead, extract the archive into misc\windows\ and
  rename the extrated folder as "sfml".
  
  Finally, you need CMake, so go ahead and download the installer from:
    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

==== BUILDING  AND INSTALLING ====
For building in Linux:
  In the parent directory, run:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

For building in Windows:
  TODO: Get this section of the tutorial done
