==== Description ====
Trouble struck the penguin community when all the fish in Antarctica
started flying out of the water. Using canvas wings and soda-bottle
rockets, they quickly took to the skies to collect fish to eat.

In this game, the point is to fly as far as possible while using limited
fuel. Extra fuel would be awarded for collecting fish.

==== Instructions ====
    Left - Turn counter-clockwise
   Right - Turn clockwise
   Space - Use thrusters
   Enter - Reset
Esc or Q - Quit

To take off, hold the [Space] key down to gain speed. When about 13 m/s
(~45 km/h) your speed is good enough for take-off. Use the [Left] and
[Right] keys to steer.

Be careful of windspeed because there wouldn't be enough lift below
10 m/s. Stall angle is about 25 degrees. At the same time don't hold on
to the thrusters for too long as the fuel is limited.

You can actually reach the first few fish without turning off the
thrusters, but you'll get trouble later when the fish are further apart.
Each time you collect a fish you earn 5 seconds of fuel.

There would be birds flying around that you have to avoid as there would
be a 2 second fuel penalty on collision. As you go further, more and
more birds would appear.

==== Modifying Variables ====
There are two ways of modifying all the variables used in the game. It
shouldn't be difficult to figure out what the variables do from their
names.

The first way is to open up "/usr/share/flying-penguin/config" and edit
whatever you want there. However, this isn't really recommended because
you would need root permissions and would affect all the other users.

A better alternative would be to copy the config file into
"~/.flying-penguin" and modify it there.
