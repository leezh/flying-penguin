Description: A game where you try to fly your penguin as far as possible
 This is a native OpenGL game inspired by the flash game Hedgehog
 Launch. The aim of the game is to launch and glide your penguin as far
 as possible. There would be bonuses in the air to keep you afloat, but
 they get further apart over distance.
